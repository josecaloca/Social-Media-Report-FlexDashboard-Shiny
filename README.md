# Social-Media-Report-FlexDashboard-Shiny

The aim of this dashboard is to present data of social media contacts for any company or influencer. 

## Context

The idea is based on a company, say a call center that manages the social media of a third company, as an outsourcing company.

Example: Amazon hires Teleperformance UK to manage Amazon's social media. Amazon provides customer service worldwide to its customers via Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. To this, Teleperformance UK, as an outsourcing company hires agents with different language skills to provide customer support to the different markets in which Amazon operates.

This dashboard uses fake data randomly generated for the purpose of illustration. However, the idea can be fully adaptable to any business need.
